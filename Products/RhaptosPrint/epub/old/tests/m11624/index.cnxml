  <para id="backboneNaming">
     Figure 1 provides examples of some aminoacids, from long ones such as 
     arginine to bulky ones such as proline, and to the smallest one,  
     glycine. Note that as we have mentioned, while different in their 
     sidechain atoms, all these aminoacids share a common group of atoms that 
     includes N, CA, C, and O. The chain that goes through this shared core is 
     known as the backbone. For the purpose of this module, you will consider 
     as the backbone the chain that goes through N, CA, and C for every 
     aminoacid. Note that there are two backbone dihedrals per aminoacid, 
     with the number of sidechain dihedrals varying depending on the aminoacid. 
     To simplify the rotation by dihedrals, in this assignment you will only 
     manipulate protein structures from which the sidechain atoms have been 
     removed. This means that you will only deal with a backbone chain that 
     goes through the N, CA, and C of every aminoacid.

  </para>    

  <para id="Peptides">
     You should be familiar with how aminoacids connect to each other through 
     the peptide bond. Figure 2 illustrates the peptide bond formed between the 
     C of an aminoacid and the N of the following aminoacid. Consecutive 
     applications of the peptide bond create the backbone chain. 
     Recall that due to its double covalent nature, the peptide bond is planar 
     (illustrated with the plane in Figure 2), and unrotatable. Therefore, in 
     your manipulation of the backbone chain, you do not need to consider the 
     peptide bond for rotation. You are left with two dihedral bonds per 
     aminoacid.

  </para>

  <para id="Polypeptide">
  Figure 3 shows four consecutive aminoacids in a polypeptide chain. Note the 
  peptide bonds that connect the aminoacids. You need to understand that 
  rotation of a backbone dihedral will affect the location of all atoms 
  following it due to the accumulation of rotations along the backbone. 
  Therefore, it is necessary for you to define an orientation for the backbone. 
  The easiest orientation is that used for the sequence of a protein, where the 
  backbone is defined as the chain starting at the N atom of the first 
  aminoacid of the sequence and ending at the C atom of the last aminoacid of 
  the sequence. For your convenience, the native conformation supplied to you 
  later in this assignment will list the coordinates of the atoms in the order 
  N, CA, C for every aminoacid. So, reading in order from this file will give 
  you the orientation of the backbone.

  <section id="Rotations">
  <name> Dihedral Rotations </name>
  
  <para id="RotationMatrix">Now it is time to actually rotate dihedral bonds. Recall from our discussion 
  of <cnxn document="m11621" target="ManipulationIntro"> Forward Kinematics </cnxn> that one can define the transformation matrix/matrices to account for a dihedral rotation, depending on the representation method you choose (global or local coordinates, as discussed below).
If you need to compute values such as bond lengths and bond angles, You can compute the bond length between two atoms as the Euclidean distance between them. You can also compute the angle between two bonds, the bond angle, as the the angle between two <link src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Norm.html"> normalized </link> vectors, which amounts to taking the <link src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DotProduct.html"> dot product </link> of the normalized vectors. If you need to identify one atom as your anchor atom, with the default backbone orientation, your anchor atom is the N of the very first aminoacid (the very first atom of the chain).
  </para>
  
  <para id="PerformRotations">Now we will put our knowledge into practice. You will manipulate the structure in the pdb file <link src="backbone_native.pdb"> 
backbone_native.pdb</link>, which is the backbone of the 1COA structure of CI2. You may want to save this pdb file for later visualization in VMD.</para>

  <section id="helpwithMatlab">
  <name> Setup with Matlab </name>
  <para id="readfromMatlab">Even though you are welcome yo use any programming language to perform 
  rotations, here we provide you with a setup for Matlab. Matlab offers a lot 
  of matrix 
  operations that you would otherwise have to implement yourself in languages 
  like C/C++, for example. We provide some hints/directions for those of 
  you who choose to implement this assignment in Matlab. The very first step 
  you need to do is to read from an ASCII file that contains the cartesian 
  coordinates of the chain you will manipulate and save these coordinates in a 
  data structure that will represent your chain. The simplest data structure at 
  this point is an array, where positions 3*(i-1)+1, 3*(i-1)+2, and 3*(i-1)+3 
  contain the coordinates of atom i. Note that Matlab starts counting from 1. 
  Take a look at the backbone_native.pdb file. Find out what the number of atoms is.  
  You can read the cartesian coordinates from the <link src="backbone_native.crd">backbone_native.crd</link> file (note that this .crd file does NOT have a dummy line at the beginning to read it easily with Matlab). You can do 
  so with the command: <code type="inline"> cartesian_coordinates  = 
  textread(input_file, '%f'); </code> where you have set the input file to 
  where you have stored backbone_native.crd as in for 
  example <code type="inline"> input_file = '/home/user_name/rest_of_the_path/backbone_native.crd' ;</code>. You can check how 
  many coordinates you have read with the command <code type="inline"> 
  length(cartesian_coordinates) </code>. 
  </para>
  
  <para id="coordinatesMatrix">
  The <code type="inline"> textread </code> command stores all coordinates 
  read from the backbone.crd file in the <code type="inline"> 
  cartesian_coordinates </code> array. You could manipulate this array with the 
  dihedral rotations you will define. However, it might be more convenient for 
  matrix operations and for clarity to store the cartesian coordinates in a 
  matrix with N rows and 3 colums for each row. In this way, row i contains all 
  the three cartesian coordinates for atom i. Define the number of atoms in the 
  backbone with the command <code type="inline"> N is 
  length(cartesian_coordinates)/3; </code>.  Now you need to declare a matrix 
  with the right dimensions. Since you actually need to work with homogeneous 
  coordinates, it might be convenient to declare a matrix with N rows and 4 
  columns, where the last column contains 1.


  You can do so with the command <code type="inline"> backbone_chain = zeros (N, 4); 
  </code> which creates a matrix with N rows and 4 columns initialized to all 
  zeros.  You can set the fourth column to 1 with the command <code type="inline"> backbone_chain(:, 4) = 1; </code>

  Now you need to place the cartesian coordinates from the array to 
  this matrix. You can do so with the for loop below: 
  <code type="block">
     for i = 1:N
         for j = 1:3
             backbone_chain(i,j) = cartesian_coordinates((i-1) * 3 + j);
         end;
     end;
  </code>
  </para>  
   
  <para id="makingRotations">The cartesian coordinates you have just read will serve as a basis for performing rotations, according to what method you choose to represent and manipulate the protein, as discussed in class. The following guidelines should help you get started with either method:</para><list id="element-221" type="bulleted"><item>If using the global coordinate (simple) approach, you can use the cartesian coordinates just read as a basis to perform rotations on them. For the most interesting task of transforming atomic positions, you simply need to iterate over the atoms affected by the transformation and multiply their position with the transformation matrix. Say the position of atom i needs to be transformed by your transformation matrix. You can do so by multiplying <code type="inline">trans_mat</code> with <code type="inline">backbone_chain(i, :)</code> as in <code type="inline">trans_mat * backbone_chain(i, :)'</code>. Note that the colon is very convenient as it gives an entire row or an entire column and that <code type="inline">backbone_chain(i, :)'</code> gives you the transpose that is necessary for the multiplication to be carried out.</item>

<item>If using the Denavit-Hartenberg local frames, you first need to extract the bond lengths and angles, and the initial dihedral angles, from the cartesian coordinates. To do so, you can loop over the atoms computing these values and storing them (for example in arrays named <code type="inline">bonds, angles, dihedrals</code>). Once this is done, you have extracted a representation of the protein in its internal coordinates and can discard the cartesian coordinates, or keep the coordinates array to store the reconstructed protein after performing manipulations. The absolute position/orientation of the protein is not important and can be ignored by assuming the anchor atom rests at the origin and that the first bond angle and dihedral angle are both zero. Remember you can perform rotations now by simply adding/subtracting from the dihedral angles, but to recover the cartesian coordinates once the rotations are done you need to build a chain of homogeneous transformations as discussed in class.</item>
</list><para id="element-1">In any case, your transformation matrices need to have dimension 4x4 to work with homogeneous coordinates. You can initialize an empty 4x4 matrix by writing  <code type="inline">trans_mat = zeros(4,4);</code>. Then you can set the elements of this matrix to what they should be for the particular method you use. You can evaluate all the cosines and sines that you need in Matlab. Matlab offers you built-in operations such as dot product or vector norm. Make sure that you understand these operations before you apply them. Recall that you can rotate any bond except the peptide bond, which is rigid.</para>

  <section id="RankingByEnergy">
  <name> Ranking by Energy </name>
 
  <para id="ComputingEnergy">Protein conformations are not only geometric 
   objects but are characterized by energetic stability. You have seen 
   that there are many empirical ways to compute the potential energy of a 
   conformation. Functions such as <link src="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/science/forcefield-tutorial/forcefield-html/node5.html"> CHARMM </link> 
   are very involved for the purpose of this assignment. Therefore, let us not 
   worry about all the energetic terms to be considered from the atomic 
   interactions. Consider only unfavorable interactions due to collisions 
   between atoms, also referred to as steric clashes. 

   Think about a simple energy function that checks for steric clashes. Your 
   function should report high energies for conformations with collisions and 
   low energies for collision-free conformations. You can model each atom as 
   a sphere with a certain radius known as the Van der Waals (VDW) radius. 
   Even though different atoms have different VDW radii, you can assume that 
   all atoms have the same radius of 1.7 A. To assist you in devising a   
   function that checks for collisions over all pairs of atoms, consider the 
   following:
    <figure id="energy_function">
    <media type="image/png" src="energy_function.png">
    <param name="width" value="200"/>
    </media>
    <caption> For all different atoms i and j, make sure that the distance 
    between their centers C is more than twice their radiuses. In this simple 
    example we are using the same radius R. </caption>

  Now think about the effect of the dihedral rotation of the last bond the 
  energetic stability of the new conformation. Please answer <cnxn target="deliverables"> Q2 </cnxn>.
  </item>

  <item>
   When you rotated a dihedral bond in the middle of the backbone until you 
   reached a conformation that had collisions, you verified the presence of 
   steric clashes by visualizing the conformation.  You can quantify the 
   presence of steric clashes now through your energy function.  Please answer 
   <cnxn target="deliverables"> Q5 </cnxn>.
  </item>
  </list>

  </para>

  <para id="MatlabEnergy">
  Again, as in dihedral rotations, you are encouraged to use Matlab. After you 
  have the cartesian coordinates of the manipulated conformation, you can 
  iterate over the atoms and check whether they are in collision with one 
  another. You can do this with a double loop. Assume that the radius of every 
  atom is the same, 1.7 A. In order to avoid reporting collisions for bonded 
  atoms, you can consider only pairs of atoms that are 4 positions apart. That 
  is, check atom i with atom i+4 for a possible steric clash.

  <section id="Submission">

  <para id="FinalSubmissionPara">NOTE: remember that in order to open a .crd file in VMD (to attach it to a loaded structure) it has to contain a dummy first line. If your implementation writes out ASCII coordinates, remember to add an empty/dummy line at the beginning before opening with VMD.
